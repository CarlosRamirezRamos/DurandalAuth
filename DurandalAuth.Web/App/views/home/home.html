<h2>Welcome to the Durandal auth authentication template</h2>
<p class="lead">The aim of this template is to be a port from the default ASP MVC 4 Internet template, providing forms and oAuth authentication with the main providers</p>
<p>Try to sign in for a new account using the <a href="/#/login">membership system or the oAuth providers</a>.</p>
<p>A role <span class="badge badge-info">User</span> will be asigned to any new user and will permit access to the <a href="/#/user">User view</a>. If you don´t want to sign in, you can use the existing one => <strong><em>user/user1234</em></strong></p>
<p>If you want to access to the <a href="/#/admin">Admin view</a> you need the role <span class="badge badge-info">Administrator</span> so you can only access the view with an admin user. Try to log in with the following one => <strong><em>admin/admin1234</em></strong></p>
